# 🔢 Even and Odd Sum Calculator

This is a Python project designed to practice **Loops** and **Conditional Logic**. The program calculates the sum of all even and odd numbers from 1 up to a user-defined limit.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The user inputs a target number.
2. The program iterates through every number from 1 to the target using a `for` loop.
3. It uses the modulo operator `%` to determine if a number is even or odd:
   - If `i % 2 == 0`, the number is **even**.
   - If `i % 2 != 0`, the number is **odd**.
4. The program displays the total sum for both categories and compares them.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
* **The `range()` function:** Generating a sequence of numbers.
* **Accumulator Pattern:** Using variables like `even_sum` and `odd_sum` to store running totals.
* **Conditional Branching:** Directing the flow of the program based on number properties.

## 🛠️ Usage
```bash
python main.py
